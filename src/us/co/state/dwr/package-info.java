 * Disclaimer: All data presented on the Colorado Division of Water Resources Current Conditions Web Site are provisional and subject to revision. These data include water levels in lakes and reservoirs, and in streams, rivers, and other water courses; computed stream discharges; and various weather parameters (temperature, precipitation, etc.). Most data relayed by satellite or other telemetry have received little or no review prior to posting on the web site.  State of Colorado Hydrographic Program Staff visit satellite monitoring gaging stations on a frequent basis to maintain equipment and ensure correct operation. They also perform discharge measurements for purposes of calibrating the stage-discharge relationship at a gage, as well as take note of physical factors present at the gage which may be affecting the stage-discharge relationship. Nevertheless, inaccuracies in the data may occur because of instrument malfunctions or physical changes at the measurement site. Subsequent review may result in significant revisions to the data.  Data users are cautioned to consider carefully the provisional nature of the information before using it for decisions that concern personal or public safety or the conduct of business that involves substantial monetary or operational consequences.
